# KiCAD PCB projects
I'm adding KiCAD related scripts and schematics for my private projects. It is a playground to experiment with board development.


## The top-level directory description

* script: KiCAD related scripts to simplify my environment; this includes generating libraries, BOM list, and modifying PCB layout
* schematic: some basic repeating schematics like power, USB, clock 
* kicad: some projects using KiCAD, including the subdirectories for the PCB production and partial assembly.
